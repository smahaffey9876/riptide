Chassis
=======

Our vehicle features a modular design that is based around a central chassis. The chassis is made from water jet aluminum sheets and joined with stainless steel fasteners. There are hard-points for for securing the tool-packages and reinforced regions to handle the vehicle. The vehicle may be carried by handles on the front and rear or hung from a crane to allow easy deployment.
