Guidelines
----------

Fasteners
~~~~~~~~~

LOCTITE 222 THREADLOCKER is applied to all bolts/screws threading into stainless steel or connecting the sealing latched to the main aluminum housing. MARING GRADE ANTI-SEIZE is applied to all other bolts/screws threading into aluminum prior to fastening. 8-32 bolts used to compress gasket should be tightened to a torque of 9 inch-pounds. All other bolts/screws should be hand-tightened.

.. warning::
   The heads of all bolts/screws must be free of wear and show no indication of stripping (damaged fasteners should be discarded immediately).

Gaskets
~~~~~~~

The rubber is free of cuts and scratches that cross the entire surface. All holes for bolts hold the fastener snuggly. When compressed, the gasket is extruded evenly around all sides.

O-Rings
~~~~~~~

The rubber is free of all nicks, cuts, excessive wear, discoloration, and/or permanent deformation. The o-ring groove is free of water and solid particles. The o-ring has been greased with MOLYKOTE 55 o-ring grease prior to every fitting.

.. warning::
   Ensure all fasteners attaching latches are tight and the sealing gasket appears compressed. DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN IF SECURED!

**Central Core:**

#. Place the DVL Tube Cap gasket on the tube.
#. Place the DVL cap on the DVL Tube Cap gasket.
#. Secure the DVL cap using DVL Tube Cap fasteners (star pattern?).
#. Place an I/O Panel gasket into the port mid housing receptacle.
#. Place the Port I/O panel atop the I/O panel gasket.
#. Secure the Port I/O panel using [some fasteners].
#. Place the remaining I/O Panel gasket into the starboard mid housing receptacle.
#. Place the starboard I/O panel atop the I/O panel gasket.
#. Secure the starboard I/O panel using [some fasteners].

**Forward Extension:**

#. Place a Clear Tube gasket between the mid-sealing ring and clear tube.
#. Use some fastener to compress this thing?
#. Place a Clear Tube gasket between the front-sealing ring and clear tube.
#. Use some (other) fastener to compress this thing?
#. Coat a Mid Housing o-ring and insert into the (furthest back?) groove.
#. Coat a Mid Housing o-ring and insert into the remaining (forward) groove.

**After Extension:**

#. Coat a Mid Housing o-ring and insert into the (furthest back?) groove.
#. Coat a Mid Housing o-ring and insert into the remaining (forward) groove.

Assembly
~~~~~~~~

#. The relief valve probably has to go on to the mounting block first.
#. Then the valve goes on, I assume.
#. Secure the valve assembly to the housing using four relief valve bolts.
#. Place the housing lid gasket on the housing.
#. Place the lid onto the housing and gasket.
#. Secure the lid using 8 fasteners in a star pattern.
